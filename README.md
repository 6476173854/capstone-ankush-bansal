Layout
Desktop View: The desktop layout includes a [brief description, e.g., "navigation bar, hero section, and grid layout for content"]. This structure allows for easy access to key features.
Responsive Design: The design was created with mobile-first principles, ensuring that all elements resize and rearrange effectively for smaller screens. Important actions remain easily accessible.

User Actions
Navigation: A clear and intuitive navigation menu was implemented at the top of the layout to facilitate user movement throughout the site.

Buttons: Call-to-action buttons are prominent and use contrasting colors to draw attention, encouraging user interaction.

Forms: Input fields and buttons are designed for usability, ensuring that users can easily submit their information.

Challenges and Solutions

Challenge: Balancing aesthetics and usability.
Solution: User testing was conducted on early mockups to gather feedback, leading to adjustments in color contrasts and button sizes for better accessibility.

Challenge: Designing for multiple screen sizes.
Solution: I used a grid system that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
